# Solution

## Part 1

Utilizing the debugger I set a breakpoint at the failing test and followed changes/loadings made to variables _(besides trying to get head around Spring after sometime... ðŸ˜… )_.

Both Pans `4319000000000001` and `5432000000000001` are loaded from the `"bin-range-info-data.json"` file on lines 61-63 in the CachingBinRangeService class, thus these tests should not fail.

Additionally Pans `4263000000000001` and `5263000000000001` are loaded via the getLatestBinRangeInfo function within the test file, thus cachingBinRangeService should not return null, these tests are working as expected.

I added an addition Pan to test (confirm) that cachingBinRangeService will return `null` when a Pan cannot be found _(or when its removed from the cache.. I could have implemented functionality but that seemed overkill so this test will suffice)_. ðŸ™Œ

## Part 2

`BinRangeService` interface updated to define service logic functions - coupled to BinRangeInfo.
I modified the `BinRangeInfoCacheController` to be loosely coupled by using the `BinService` interface instead of its actual implementation.
Every test was created using Test Driven Development principles.

Examples are using [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/) instead of `curl` (I messed around with my curl settings and never changed them back ðŸ˜‘).

### Endpoints

#### GET

Not required but I implemented it for my own testing.

##### Example Usage

```bash
http GET http://localhost:8080/binRangeInfoCache/
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200

        "start": 4319000000000000
    }
}
```

<hr>

#### POST

##### Edge Cases

- If the Bin Range already exists.
- Data Validation.
- Ref can be supplied but it will be replaced with the server side generated ref.
- If the BinRange already exists.

##### Assumptions

- Data Validation: `start`, `end`, `bankName` and `currencyCode` cannot be `null` values. `Ref` can be `null` since its generated on the server side and if it is provided its overridden.

```

<hr>

#### PUT

##### Edge Cases

- Start and End range cannot be modified.
- The path variable i.e. ref and Bin Range ref should match _(not a business requirement but its best for validation)_.
- If the BinRange requested to update doesnt exist.

##### Assumptions

- Since a ref needs to be provided via a PathVariable and the json payload i.e. `BinRangeInfo` also provides a ref value they need to match.
  You could implement logic to set the json payload ref if its not provided but I think its best the user also provides it to ensure the correct BinRange is being updated. If the refs dont match a `BinRangeInfoInvalidException` is thrown.

- The start and end range cannot be modified once inserted. If they dont a `BinRangeInfoInvalidException` is thrown.

- Data Validation.

## Part 3

I updated the `Event` interface to be generic so it can handle multiple different types of audit events (this violates the YAGNI but I'm positive if this was a solution in production a new type of audit event would eventually be required. `AuditSubscriber` was also updated to handle the modified Event interface.

I didnt implement tests for EventBus because they werent asked for but if I were too I'd mock EventBus and ensure register was called `x times` and for the `publishAsync` method called `EventBus.post`.

I added additional tests for `AuditEvent`, specifically its `toString` method to ensure its outputting the valid format for logs.

### Example Log File

```log
createdAt={Wed Jul 28 17:07:01 BST 2021}, before={BinRangeInfo: ref=31fde6df-b594-477c-af57-f436b0c04842, start=2398000000000000, end=2398999999999999, bankName=Rempel, Rempel and Rempel, currencyCode=BRL}, after={BinRangeInfo: ref=31fde6df-b594-477c-af57-f436b0c04842, start=8764000000000000, end=8764999999999999, bankName=Cartwright LLC, currencyCode=NGN}
```

## Conclusion

Hopefully this solution suffices, it took me a while (a lot of Googling) to figure out how Spring works again along with Java's testing libraries but I got there in the end (`;` _are a nuisance after using Python for so long_) :).
