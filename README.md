# Mastercard Technical Evaluation (Bin Range Application)

## Preamble

BIN (Bank Identification Number) Ranges are used to provide information such as issuer currency code,
bank name along with other relevant information for a given PAN (Primary account number)
In Mastercard we often use BIN Ranges for enriching our decision making capabilities. It is therefore essential to have an
up to date copy of the latest BIN Range information.

This application provides a HTTP REST interface for retrieving BIN Range info for a given PAN. BIN Ranges are loaded from a
file on disk which is updated on a fixed schedule. This file is then stored in a simple cache so as to provide fast lookup for the HTTP interface.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your development machine:

- Java 8
- Git
- Maven 3

Please clone this repository to your local workspace and develop your solution on a feature branch.
When finished submit a single merge request containing all your changes.

N.B) if you want to clone the project using SSH you will need to add you public key to your gitlab profile,
alternatively you can clone the project using HTTPS

## The Challenge

- Your challenge will be broken down in to 3 parts of varying difficulty. Try to complete **ALL** parts.
- Please focus on the basics like ensuring you write good unit tests and perform data validation.
- Please rad through all instructions fully to ensure you understand what deliverables are expected.
- Your solution will be assessed based on your relevant skills and experience.

**N.B. Important Instruction: Please complete ALL parts**

### Part 1. Approximately 20 minutes

We have recently pushed some code to the repository which seems to have broken a unit test
This unit test has since been marked as ignored to fix the build temporarily. Your job is to fix the functionality
according to the failing test cases in `CachingBinRangeServiceTest.java`.
You can assume that the BIN Ranges do not change, however the data they refer to I.E. Bank Name and Currency Code can change
You should also expect that a BIN Range can be removed from the cache.

N.B. The test should not be modified however additional tests would be welcomed to ensure this functionality does not break again.

### Part 2. Approximately 50 minutes

Update the existing `BinRangeInfoCacheController.java` controller to add additional endpoints to handle
the `CREATE`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` actions on the BIN Range cache entries in case we need to modify the cache in between
the scheduled period whereby the cache is refreshed from the file.

The endpoints should handle the cache entries individually I.E. this is not a batch API,
Please note that a range start and end cannot change however the data they refer to can also there is the possibility of
sub ranges I.E. a range that fits within a wider range however no ranges should share a start or end.

The `CREATE` endpoint should take a JSON representation of a `BinRangeInfo.class` in the body, please note the ref is generated on the server side
The `UPDATE` endpoint should take a JSON representation of a `BinRangeInfo.class` in the body and the ref as a path param.
The `DELETE` endpoint should take the ref associated with the desired `BinRangeInfo.class` entry in the cache as a path param, please ensure the index gets updated also.

Please ensure to create / update any relevant test cases to verify this new functionality,

### Part 3. Approximately 50 minutes

We have recently received a new requirement to maintain an audit log for all changes to the cache for
historical audit and debugging purposes. Some of the work for this has already been completed with the creation of the `EventManager.java`
and the `AuditSubscriber.java` this event bus will be used to asynchronously update the audit log.
It is your task to complete the functionality of this audit log to match the requirement in the JavaDoc found at `AuditSubscriber.handleEvent()`
please ensure to have this functionality covered by adequate unit tests.

## The Deliverable

Please ensure that this code is buildable by running `mvn clean install` and the application
runs successfully with `java -jar target/mastercard-evaluation-bin-range-application-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

- Please include documentation in SOLUTION.md about your approach and any assumptions you may have made while completing the above steps.
- Please include sample `curl` requests in your SOLUTION.md for each endpoint you develop.
- Create one Merge Request containing your changes for all of your work and notify the hiring manager by email when it is ready for review.

# Solution

## Part 1

Utilizing the debugger I set a breakpoint at the failing test and followed changes/loadings made to variables _(besides trying to get head around Spring after sometime... ðŸ˜… )_.

Both Pans `4319000000000001` and `5432000000000001` are loaded from the `"bin-range-info-data.json"` file on lines 61-63 in the CachingBinRangeService class, thus these tests should not fail.

Additionally Pans `4263000000000001` and `5263000000000001` are loaded via the getLatestBinRangeInfo function within the test file, thus cachingBinRangeService should not return null, these tests are working as expected.

I added an addition Pan to test (confirm) that cachingBinRangeService will return `null` when a Pan cannot be found _(or when its removed from the cache.. I could have implemented functionality but that seemed overkill so this test will suffice)_. ðŸ™Œ

<hr>

## Part 2

`BinRangeService` interface updated to define service logic functions - coupled to BinRangeInfo.
I modified the `BinRangeInfoCacheController` to be loosely coupled by using the `BinService` interface instead of its actual implementation.
Every test was created using Test Driven Development principles.

Examples are using [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/) instead of `curl` (I messed around with my curl settings and never changed them back ðŸ˜‘).

### Endpoints

#### GET

Not required but I implemented it for my own testing.

##### Example Usage

```bash
http GET http://localhost:8080/binRangeInfoCache/
```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200

        "start": 4319000000000000
    }
}
```

<hr>

#### POST

##### Edge Cases

- If the Bin Range already exists.
- Data Validation.
- Ref can be supplied but it will be replaced with the server side generated ref.
- If the BinRange already exists.

##### Assumptions

- Data Validation: `start`, `end`, `bankName` and `currencyCode` cannot be `null` values. `Ref` can be `null` since its generated on the server side and if it is provided its overridden.

```

<hr>

#### PUT

##### Edge Cases

- Start and End range cannot be modified.
- The path variable i.e. ref and Bin Range ref should match _(not a business requirement but its best for validation)_.
- If the BinRange requested to update doesnt exist.

##### Assumptions

- Since a ref needs to be provided via a PathVariable and the json payload i.e. `BinRangeInfo` also provides a ref value they need to match.
  You could implement logic to set the json payload ref if its not provided but I think its best the user also provides it to ensure the correct BinRange is being updated. If the refs dont match a `BinRangeInfoInvalidException` is thrown.

- The start and end range cannot be modified once inserted. If they dont a `BinRangeInfoInvalidException` is thrown.

- Data Validation.

## Part 3

I updated the `Event` interface to be generic so it can handle multiple different types of audit events (this violates the YAGNI but I'm positive if this was a solution in production a new type of audit event would eventually be required. `AuditSubscriber` was also updated to handle the modified Event interface.

I didnt implement tests for EventBus because they werent asked for but if I were too I'd mock EventBus and ensure register was called `x times` and for the `publishAsync` method called `EventBus.post`.

I added additional tests for `AuditEvent`, specifically its `toString` method to ensure its outputting the valid format for logs.

### Example Log File

```log
createdAt={Wed Jul 28 17:07:01 BST 2021}, before={BinRangeInfo: ref=31fde6df-b594-477c-af57-f436b0c04842, start=2398000000000000, end=2398999999999999, bankName=Rempel, Rempel and Rempel, currencyCode=BRL}, after={BinRangeInfo: ref=31fde6df-b594-477c-af57-f436b0c04842, start=8764000000000000, end=8764999999999999, bankName=Cartwright LLC, currencyCode=NGN}
```

## Conclusion

Hopefully this solution suffices, it took me a while (a lot of Googling) to figure out how Spring works again along with Java's testing libraries but I got there in the end (`;` _are a nuisance after using Python for so long_) :).
